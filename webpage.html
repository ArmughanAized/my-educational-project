<P>Cricket is one of the most popular & exciting outdoor sports.A cricket math is alway interesting whether it is played at international level or national level.          
Modern media has made this game more  popular and now every Pkistani is under the cricket fever.At every level it is liked and played by cricket lovers.Some of
us get the opportunity to play first class cricket ,but there are millions who enjoy seen it being played.It gives us moments of leisure and pleasure and fills us
with a competetive spirit.I witnessed demonstration of the greatest excitement and determination at Ntional Stadium,Karachi.</P>



<P>It was a fine day .A large number of a people including men,women & children from all walks of life gathered there to enjoy the math between Pakistan and
India ,to be good sports team,one has to be aggressive and this was shown in the final between the 30 teams.India won the toss and invited to bat first.This was a
big blunder that their captain had made.Shahid Afridi and Saeed Anwer sent as openers.It was the right decision by the captain,because Shahid Afridi slammed the ball
over the feild,it was due to his efforts that Pakistan acheived a good start.Saeed Anwer was very careful and most of the  time simply obstructed.The bowling was quite
stong ,due to which Saeed Anwer was not able to score a single run for the first fifteen minuts.</P>



<P>But as time passed ,he grasped the strategy of the bowlers and begin to get Afridi fly the bowl.He completed his half century by playing keen beautiful shots.When 
he was ata a score of 88 ,the first slip caught him smartly.In this way,the first wicket of Pakistan fell a total of 130.After him,Shahid Afridi couldn`t  steadily face
the bowlers  and proceeded toward the pavilion in a short time.</P>



<P>Ejaaz Ahmed begin his batting when the Pkistani team was playing at 135 and took the score to 170.The next four men were dimissed very quickly-two bowled,one caught
and one bowled out leg before wicket.However,Moin Khan made a stand and was able to increase the score to 218.At this moment,10 overs were remaining and three wickets in
hand.Wasim Akram played a beautiful innings and Pkistani team snachted a total of 269.</P>




<P>It was a great victory to enjoy.Large numbers of spectators had also enjoyed the match.We celebrated our win with great fun.</P>




<P>It was no doubt,a very thrilling and exciting macth.We all watched it with a throbbing heart till the last moment.It was indeed a memorible macth which I shall
remember for a long time.</P>
